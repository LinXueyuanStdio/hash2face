def _find_elementwise_sub_graph(graph: Graph) -> List[Graph]:
    """
    Find all sub graphs which are consisted of only elementwise operators

    For each sub graph, follow conditions are checked about all input variable :code:`x`.

        - :code:`x.output_from` is elementwise operator.
        - All operators in :code`x.input_to` are included in sub graph

    And if satisfied, `x.output_from` is merged into sub graph. If `x.output_from` is already merged into other sub graph, then two sub
    graph are merged into single sub graph.

    In follow examples, let all operators be elementwise.

    Considering :code:`v1`,
        - :code:`v1.output_from = op1` is elementwise operator.
        - :code:`v1.input_to` contains only :code:`op3`, which is included in sub graph.

    Therefore :code:`op1` is merged into sub graph, and :code:`v0` is registered as input variable.

    Considering :code:`v0`,
        - :code:`v0.output_from = op0` is elementwise operator.
        - :code:`v0.input_to` is :code:`op1` and :code:`op2`, and op2 is not included in sub graph

    Therefore :code:`op0` cannot be merged into sub graph.
